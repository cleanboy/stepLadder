A jQuery plugin for your menu.
Suprisingly this does not exist already!? That is to say I looked pretty damn hard but couldnt find anything like it...

 StepLadder - a menu animation plugin
 Must be called on a nested ul > li > ul > li

 Usage: $('ul').stepLadder(time, fadetime);
 Where time is the amount of time before each li loads one after the other.
